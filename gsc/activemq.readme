There are three main ways to disable persistence, such as for unit testing JMS code

Set the NON_PERSISTENT message delivery flag on your MessageProducer
Set the persistent=false flag in the <broker/> element of the Xml Configuration or on the property BrokerService
Delete the persistence files before running your tests (a bit hacky)
